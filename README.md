*Five years ago I had an idea that won Angelhack hackathon. The idea came up because of my need to be a responsible dog owner. I got tired of calendar notifications and spreadsheets. I designed, analysed and led the project and with the help of my team we developed a web app in a 24hour marathon. Unfortunately our team didn't manage to work it out and the idea didn't move forward. Now 5 years later I still can't find an application (the way I want it) to help me throw away the anxiety of forgeting something important.
That's why I decided to bring back the idea and develop it myself as a mobile application this time.* *"Do you guys not have phones?"*

### Stay tuned miDog is back!❤️
